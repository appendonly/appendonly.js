# append

Append some data to a stream.

If the stream exists and `currentHash` is passed in, the operation
will only succeed if the head of the stream points to currentHash.

If the stream doesn't exist or is not open an Error is throw.

**Parameters**

-   `streamId` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Your stream identifier
-   `currentHash` **\[multihash]** 
-   `data` **([Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) \| [String](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) \| [Number](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number) \| [Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean))** 

# replay

Replay the stream.

**Parameters**

-   `streamId` **[string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** Your stream identifier
-   `opts` **\[[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)]** behaviour modifiers
    -   `opts.startHash` **\[multihash]** If this value is given, it refers
        to a point in the stream and replay of the stream starts at that
        position. Otherwise the stream is played from the beginning.
    -   `opts.stopHash` **\[multihash]** The stream is closed when this state
        is reached. Otherwise the stream stops when the head state is reached.
    -   `opts.includeData` **\[[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)]** If set to true, the result
        stream contains a `data` property, ie. [get](get) is called on the
        hashes for you.

# subscribe

Follow the stream.

Like [replay](replay) except the default starting position is the
head of the stream instead of the beginning.

The other difference is that this stream only stops when the
log is closed. A replay stream stops when the head position is
reached (stream has caught up).

**Parameters**

-   `streamId` **StreamId** Your stream identifier
-   `opts` **\[[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)]** behaviour modifiers
    -   `opts.startHash` **\[multihash]** If this value is given, it refers
        to a point in the stream and replay of the stream starts at that
        position. Otherwise the stream is played from the beginning.
    -   `opts.excludeData` **\[[Boolean](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Boolean)]** If set to true, the result
        stream contains a `data` property, ie. [get](get) is called on the
        hashes for you.

Returns **LogStream** 

# current

Retrieve the head hash op the stream

Returns **multihash** 

# get

Retrieve the data corresponding to a multihash

**Parameters**

-   `multihash` **multishash** the state to retrieve

Returns **([Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object) \| [string](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String) \| [Buffer](https://nodejs.org/api/buffer.html))**
